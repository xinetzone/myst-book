Spaces and tabs are allowed between the characters:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
 - - -
``````
---
``````
<hr />
``````
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
 **  * ** * ** * **
``````
---
``````
<hr />
``````
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
-     -      -      -
``````
---
``````
<hr />
``````
````````````````````````````````


Spaces and tabs are allowed at the end:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
- - - -    
``````
---
``````
<hr />
``````
````````````````````````````````


However, no other characters may occur in the line:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
_ _ _ _ a

a------

---a---
---
``````
<p>_ _ _ _ a</p>
<p>a------</p>
<p>---a---</p>
``````
````````````````````````````````


It is required that all of the characters other than spaces or tabs be the same.
So, this is not a thematic break:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
 *-*
``````
---
``````
<p><em>-</em></p>
``````
````````````````````````````````


Thematic breaks do not need blank lines before or after:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
- foo
***
- bar
``````
---
``````
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
``````
````````````````````````````````


Thematic breaks can interrupt a paragraph:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
Foo
***
bar
``````
---
``````
<p>Foo</p>
<hr />
<p>bar</p>
``````
````````````````````````````````


If a line of dashes that meets the above conditions for being a
thematic break could also be interpreted as the underline of a [setext
heading], the interpretation as a
[setext heading] takes precedence. Thus, for{panels},
this is a setext heading, not a paragraph followed by a thematic break:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
Foo
---
bar
``````
---
``````
<h2>Foo</h2>
<p>bar</p>
``````
````````````````````````````````


When both a thematic break and a list item are possible
interpretations of a line, the thematic break takes precedence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
* Foo
* * *
* Bar
``````
---
``````
<ul>
<li>Foo</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Bar</li>
</ul>
``````
````````````````````````````````


If you want a thematic break in a list item, use a different bullet:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``````
- Foo
- * * *
``````
---
``````
<ul>
<li>Foo</li>
<li>
<hr />
</li>
</ul>
``````
````````````````````````````````



## ATX headings

An [ATX heading](#@)
consists of a string of characters, parsed as inline content, between an
opening sequence of 1--6 unescaped `#` characters and an optional
closing sequence of any number of unescaped `#` characters.
The opening sequence of `#` characters must be followed by spaces or tabs, or
by the end of line. The optional closing sequence of `#`s must be preceded by
spaces or tabs and may be followed by spaces or tabs only.  The opening
`#` character may be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation.  The raw
contents of the heading are stripped of leading and trailing space or tabs
before being parsed as inline content.  The heading level is equal to the number
of `#` characters in the opening sequence.

Simple headings:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# foo
## foo
### foo
#### foo
##### foo
###### foo
.
<h1>foo</h1>
<h2>foo</h2>
<h3>foo</h3>
<h4>foo</h4>
<h5>foo</h5>
<h6>foo</h6>
````````````````````````````````


More than six `#` characters is not a heading:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
####### foo
.
<p>####### foo</p>
````````````````````````````````


At least one space or tab is required between the `#` characters and the
heading's contents, unless the heading is empty.  Note that many
implementations currently do not require the space.  However, the
space was required by the
[original ATX implementation](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/atx.py),
and it helps prevent things like the following from being parsed as
headings:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
#5 bolt

#hashtag
.
<p>#5 bolt</p>
<p>#hashtag</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a heading, because the first `#` is escaped:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
\## foo
.
<p>## foo</p>
````````````````````````````````


Contents are parsed as inlines:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# foo *bar* \*baz\*
.
<h1>foo <em>bar</em> *baz*</h1>
````````````````````````````````


Leading and trailing spaces or tabs are ignored in parsing inline content:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
#                  foo                     
.
<h1>foo</h1>
````````````````````````````````


Up to three spaces of indentation are allowed:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
 ### foo
  ## foo
   # foo
.
<h3>foo</h3>
<h2>foo</h2>
<h1>foo</h1>
````````````````````````````````


Four spaces of indentation is too many:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    # foo
.
<pre><code># foo
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
foo
    # bar
.
<p>foo
# bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


A closing sequence of `#` characters is optional:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
## foo ##
  ###   bar    ###
.
<h2>foo</h2>
<h3>bar</h3>
````````````````````````````````


It need not be the same length as the opening sequence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# foo ##################################
##### foo ##
.
<h1>foo</h1>
<h5>foo</h5>
````````````````````````````````


Spaces or tabs are allowed after the closing sequence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
### foo ###     
.
<h3>foo</h3>
````````````````````````````````


A sequence of `#` characters with anything but spaces or tabs following it
is not a closing sequence, but counts as part of the contents of the
heading:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
### foo ### b
.
<h3>foo ### b</h3>
````````````````````````````````


The closing sequence must be preceded by a space or tab:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# foo#
.
<h1>foo#</h1>
````````````````````````````````


Backslash-escaped `#` characters do not count as part
of the closing sequence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
### foo \###
## foo #\##
# foo \#
.
<h3>foo ###</h3>
<h2>foo ###</h2>
<h1>foo #</h1>
````````````````````````````````


ATX headings need not be separated from surrounding content by blank
lines, and they can interrupt paragraphs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
****
## foo
****
.
<hr />
<h2>foo</h2>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo bar
# baz
Bar foo
.
<p>Foo bar</p>
<h1>baz</h1>
<p>Bar foo</p>
````````````````````````````````


ATX headings can be empty:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
## 
#
### ###
.
<h2></h2>
<h1></h1>
<h3></h3>
````````````````````````````````


## Setext headings

A [setext heading](#@) consists of one or more
lines of text, not interrupted by a blank line, of which the first line does not
have more than 3 spaces of indentation, followed by
a [setext heading underline].  The lines of text must be such
that, were they not followed by the setext heading underline,
they would be interpreted as a paragraph:  they cannot be
interpretable as a [code fence], [ATX heading][ATX headings],
[block quote][block quotes], [thematic break][thematic breaks],
[list item][list items], or [HTML block][HTML blocks].

A [setext heading underline](#@) is a sequence of
`=` characters or a sequence of `-` characters, with no more than 3
spaces of indentation and any number of trailing spaces or tabs.

The heading is a level 1 heading if `=` characters are used in
the [setext heading underline], and a level 2 heading if `-`
characters are used.  The contents of the heading are the result
of parsing the preceding lines of text as CommonMark inline
content.

In general, a setext heading need not be preceded or followed by a
blank line.  However, it cannot interrupt a paragraph, so when a
setext heading comes after a paragraph, a blank line is needed between
them.

Simple{panels}s:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo *bar*
=========

Foo *bar*
---------
.
<h1>Foo <em>bar</em></h1>
<h2>Foo <em>bar</em></h2>
````````````````````````````````


The content of the header may span more than one line:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo *bar
baz*
====
.
<h1>Foo <em>bar
baz</em></h1>
````````````````````````````````

The contents are the result of parsing the headings's raw
content as inlines.  The heading's raw content is formed by
concatenating the lines and removing initial and final
spaces or tabs.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
  Foo *bar
baz*â†’
====
.
<h1>Foo <em>bar
baz</em></h1>
````````````````````````````````


The underlining can be any length:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
-------------------------

Foo
=
.
<h2>Foo</h2>
<h1>Foo</h1>
````````````````````````````````


The heading content can be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation, and
need not line up with the underlining:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
   Foo
---

  Foo
-----

  Foo
  ===
.
<h2>Foo</h2>
<h2>Foo</h2>
<h1>Foo</h1>
````````````````````````````````


Four spaces of indentation is too many:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    Foo
    ---

    Foo
---
.
<pre><code>Foo
---

Foo
</code></pre>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


The setext heading underline can be preceded by up to three spaces of
indentation, and may have trailing spaces or tabs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
   ----      
.
<h2>Foo</h2>
````````````````````````````````


Four spaces of indentation is too many:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
    ---
.
<p>Foo
---</p>
````````````````````````````````


The setext heading underline cannot contain internal spaces or tabs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
= =

Foo
--- -
.
<p>Foo
= =</p>
<p>Foo</p>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


Trailing spaces or tabs in the content line do not cause a hard line break:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo  
-----
.
<h2>Foo</h2>
````````````````````````````````


Nor does a backslash at the end:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo\
----
.
<h2>Foo\</h2>
````````````````````````````````


Since indicators of block structure take precedence over
indicators of inline structure, the following are setext headings:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
`Foo
----
`

<a title="a lot
---
of dashes"/>
.
<h2>`Foo</h2>
<p>`</p>
<h2>&lt;a title=&quot;a lot</h2>
<p>of dashes&quot;/&gt;</p>
````````````````````````````````


The setext heading underline cannot be a [lazy continuation
line] in a list item or block quote:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
> Foo
---
.
<blockquote>
<p>Foo</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
> foo
bar
===
.
<blockquote>
<p>foo
bar
===</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
- Foo
---
.
<ul>
<li>Foo</li>
</ul>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


A blank line is needed between a paragraph and a following
setext heading, since otherwise the paragraph becomes part
of the heading's content:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
Bar
---
.
<h2>Foo
Bar</h2>
````````````````````````````````


But in general a blank line is not required before or after
setext headings:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
---
Foo
---
Bar
---
Baz
.
<hr />
<h2>Foo</h2>
<h2>Bar</h2>
<p>Baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


Setext headings cannot be empty:

````````````````````````````````{panels}

====
.
<p>====</p>
````````````````````````````````


Setext heading text lines must not be interpretable as block
constructs other than paragraphs.  So, the line of dashes
in these{panels}s gets interpreted as a thematic break:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
---
---
.
<hr />
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
- foo
-----
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
    foo
---
.
<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
> foo
-----
.
<blockquote>
<p>foo</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


If you want a heading with `> foo` as its literal text, you can
use backslash escapes:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
\> foo
------
.
<h2>&gt; foo</h2>
````````````````````````````````


**Compatibility note:**  Most existing Markdown implementations
do not allow the text of setext headings to span multiple lines.
But there is no consensus about how to interpret

``` markdown
Foo
bar
---
baz
```

One can find four different interpretations:

1. paragraph "Foo", heading "bar", paragraph "baz"
2. paragraph "Foo bar", thematic break, paragraph "baz"
3. paragraph "Foo bar --- baz"
4. heading "Foo bar", paragraph "baz"

We find interpretation 4 most natural, and interpretation 4
increases the expressive power of CommonMark, by allowing
multiline headings.  Authors who want interpretation 1 can
put a blank line after the first paragraph:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo

bar
---
baz
.
<p>Foo</p>
<h2>bar</h2>
<p>baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


Authors who want interpretation 2 can put blank lines around
the thematic break,

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
bar

---

baz
.
<p>Foo
bar</p>
<hr />
<p>baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


or use a thematic break that cannot count as a [setext heading
underline], such as

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
bar
* * *
baz
.
<p>Foo
bar</p>
<hr />
<p>baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


Authors who want interpretation 3 can use backslash escapes:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
bar
\---
baz
.
<p>Foo
bar
---
baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


## Indented code blocks

An [indented code block](#@) is composed of one or more
[indented chunks] separated by blank lines.
An [indented chunk](#@) is a sequence of non-blank lines,
each preceded by four or more spaces of indentation. The contents of the code
block are the literal contents of the lines, including trailing
[line endings], minus four spaces of indentation.
An indented code block has no [info string].

An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph, so there must be
a blank line between a paragraph and a following indented code block.
(A blank line is not needed, however, between a code block and a following
paragraph.)

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    a simple
      indented code block
.
<pre><code>a simple
  indented code block
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


If there is any ambiguity between an interpretation of indentation
as a code block and as indicating that material belongs to a [list
item][list items], the list item interpretation takes precedence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
  - foo

    bar
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
1.  foo

    - bar
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<ul>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````



The contents of a code block are literal text, and do not get parsed
as Markdown:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    <a/>
    *hi*

    - one
.
<pre><code>&lt;a/&gt;
*hi*

- one
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Here we have three chunks separated by blank lines:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    chunk1

    chunk2
  
 
 
    chunk3
.
<pre><code>chunk1

chunk2



chunk3
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Any initial spaces or tabs beyond four spaces of indentation will be included in
the content, even in interior blank lines:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    chunk1
      
      chunk2
.
<pre><code>chunk1
  
  chunk2
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


An indented code block cannot interrupt a paragraph.  (This
allows hanging indents and the like.)

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
    bar

.
<p>Foo
bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


However, any non-blank line with fewer than four spaces of indentation ends
the code block immediately.  So a paragraph may occur immediately
after indented code:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    foo
bar
.
<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


And indented code can occur immediately before and after other kinds of
blocks:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# Heading
    foo
Heading
------
    foo
----
.
<h1>Heading</h1>
<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>
<h2>Heading</h2>
<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>
<hr />
````````````````````````````````


The first line can be preceded by more than four spaces of indentation:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
        foo
    bar
.
<pre><code>    foo
bar
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Blank lines preceding or following an indented code block
are not included in it:

````````````````````````````````{panels}

    
    foo
    

.
<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Trailing spaces or tabs are included in the code block's content:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    foo  
.
<pre><code>foo  
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````



## Fenced code blocks

A [code fence](#@) is a sequence
of at least three consecutive backtick characters (`` ` ``) or
tildes (`~`).  (Tildes and backticks cannot be mixed.)
A [fenced code block](#@)
begins with a code fence, preceded by up to three spaces of indentation.

The line with the opening code fence may optionally contain some text
following the code fence; this is trimmed of leading and trailing
spaces or tabs and called the [info string](#@). If the [info string] comes
after a backtick fence, it may not contain any backtick
characters.  (The reason for this restriction is that otherwise
some inline code would be incorrectly interpreted as the
beginning of a fenced code block.)

The content of the code block consists of all subsequent lines, until
a closing [code fence] of the same type as the code block
began with (backticks or tildes), and with at least as many backticks
or tildes as the opening code fence.  If the leading code fence is
preceded by N spaces of indentation, then up to N spaces of indentation are
removed from each line of the content (if present).  (If a content line is not
indented, it is preserved unchanged.  If it is indented N spaces or less, all
of the indentation is removed.)

The closing code fence may be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation, and
may be followed only by spaces or tabs, which are ignored.  If the end of the
containing block (or document) is reached and no closing code fence
has been found, the code block contains all of the lines after the
opening code fence until the end of the containing block (or
document).  (An alternative spec would require backtracking in the
event that a closing code fence is not found.  But this makes parsing
much less efficient, and there seems to be no real down side to the
behavior described here.)

A fenced code block may interrupt a paragraph, and does not require
a blank line either before or after.

The content of a code fence is treated as literal text, not parsed
as inlines.  The first word of the [info string] is typically used to
specify the language of the code sample, and rendered in the `class`
attribute of the `code` tag.  However, this spec does not mandate any
particular treatment of the [info string].

Here is a simple{panels} with backticks:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
<
 >
```
.
<pre><code>&lt;
 &gt;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


With tildes:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~
<
 >
~~~
.
<pre><code>&lt;
 &gt;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````

Fewer than three backticks is not enough:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``
foo
``
.
<p><code>foo</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

The closing code fence must use the same character as the opening
fence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
aaa
~~~
```
.
<pre><code>aaa
~~~
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~
aaa
```
~~~
.
<pre><code>aaa
```
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


The closing code fence must be at least as long as the opening fence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
````
aaa
```
``````
.
<pre><code>aaa
```
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~~
aaa
~~~
~~~~
.
<pre><code>aaa
~~~
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Unclosed code blocks are closed by the end of the document
(or the enclosing [block quote][block quotes] or [list item][list items]):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
.
<pre><code></code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
`````

```
aaa
.
<pre><code>
```
aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
> ```
> aaa

bbb
.
<blockquote>
<pre><code>aaa
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


A code block can have all empty lines as its content:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```

  
```
.
<pre><code>
  
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


A code block can be empty:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
```
.
<pre><code></code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Fences can be indented.  If the opening fence is indented,
content lines will have equivalent opening indentation removed,
if present:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
 ```
 aaa
aaa
```
.
<pre><code>aaa
aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
  ```
aaa
  aaa
aaa
  ```
.
<pre><code>aaa
aaa
aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
   ```
   aaa
    aaa
  aaa
   ```
.
<pre><code>aaa
 aaa
aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Four spaces of indentation is too many:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    ```
    aaa
    ```
.
<pre><code>```
aaa
```
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Closing fences may be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation, and their
indentation need not match that of the opening fence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
aaa
  ```
.
<pre><code>aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
   ```
aaa
  ```
.
<pre><code>aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a closing fence, because it is indented 4 spaces:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
aaa
    ```
.
<pre><code>aaa
    ```
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````



Code fences (opening and closing) cannot contain internal spaces or tabs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``` ```
aaa
.
<p><code> </code>
aaa</p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~~~~
aaa
~~~ ~~
.
<pre><code>aaa
~~~ ~~
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Fenced code blocks can interrupt paragraphs, and can be followed
directly by paragraphs, without a blank line between:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
foo
```
bar
```
baz
.
<p>foo</p>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
<p>baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


Other blocks can also occur before and after fenced code blocks
without an intervening blank line:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
foo
---
~~~
bar
~~~
# baz
.
<h2>foo</h2>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
<h1>baz</h1>
````````````````````````````````


An [info string] can be provided after the opening code fence.
Although this spec doesn't mandate any particular treatment of
the info string, the first word is typically used to specify
the language of the code block. In HTML output, the language is
normally indicated by adding a class to the `code` element consisting
of `language-` followed by the language name.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```ruby
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
```
.
<pre><code class="language-ruby">def foo(x)
  return 3
end
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~~    ruby startline=3 $%@#$
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
~~~~~~~
.
<pre><code class="language-ruby">def foo(x)
  return 3
end
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
````;
````
.
<pre><code class="language-;"></code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


[Info strings] for backtick code blocks cannot contain backticks:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
``` aa ```
foo
.
<p><code>aa</code>
foo</p>
````````````````````````````````


[Info strings] for tilde code blocks can contain backticks and tildes:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
~~~ aa ``` ~~~
foo
~~~
.
<pre><code class="language-aa">foo
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


Closing code fences cannot have [info strings]:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
``` aaa
```
.
<pre><code>``` aaa
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````



## HTML blocks

An [HTML block](#@) is a group of lines that is treated
as raw HTML (and will not be escaped in HTML output).

There are seven kinds of [HTML block], which can be defined by their
start and end conditions.  The block begins with a line that meets a
[start condition](#@) (after up to three optional spaces of indentation).
It ends with the first subsequent line that meets a matching
[end condition](#@), or the last line of the document, or the last line of
the [container block](#container-blocks) containing the current HTML
block, if no line is encountered that meets the [end condition].  If
the first line meets both the [start condition] and the [end
condition], the block will contain just that line.

1.  **Start condition:**  line begins with the string `<pre`,
`<script`, `<style`, or `<textarea` (case-insensitive), followed by a space,
a tab, the string `>`, or the end of the line.\
**End condition:**  line contains an end tag
`</pre>`, `</script>`, `</style>`, or `</textarea>` (case-insensitive; it
need not match the start tag).

2.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<!--`.\
**End condition:**  line contains the string `-->`.

3.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<?`.\
**End condition:** line contains the string `?>`.

4.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<!`
followed by an ASCII letter.\
**End condition:** line contains the character `>`.

5.  **Start condition:**  line begins with the string
`<![CDATA[`.\
**End condition:** line contains the string `]]>`.

6.  **Start condition:** line begins the string `<` or `</`
followed by one of the strings (case-insensitive) `address`,
`article`, `aside`, `base`, `basefont`, `blockquote`, `body`,
`caption`, `center`, `col`, `colgroup`, `dd`, `details`, `dialog`,
`dir`, `div`, `dl`, `dt`, `fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`,
`footer`, `form`, `frame`, `frameset`,
`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `head`, `header`, `hr`,
`html`, `iframe`, `legend`, `li`, `link`, `main`, `menu`, `menuitem`,
`nav`, `noframes`, `ol`, `optgroup`, `option`, `p`, `param`,
`section`, `source`, `summary`, `table`, `tbody`, `td`,
`tfoot`, `th`, `thead`, `title`, `tr`, `track`, `ul`, followed
by a space, a tab, the end of the line, the string `>`, or
the string `/>`.\
**End condition:** line is followed by a [blank line].

7.  **Start condition:**  line begins with a complete [open tag]
(with any [tag name] other than `pre`, `script`,
`style`, or `textarea`) or a complete [closing tag],
followed by zero or more spaces and tabs, followed by the end of the line.\
**End condition:** line is followed by a [blank line].

HTML blocks continue until they are closed by their appropriate
[end condition], or the last line of the document or other [container
block](#container-blocks).  This means any HTML **within an HTML
block** that might otherwise be recognised as a start condition will
be ignored by the parser and passed through as-is, without changing
the parser's state.

For instance, `<pre>` within an HTML block started by `<table>` will not affect
the parser state; as the HTML block was started in by start condition 6, it
will end at any blank line. This can be surprising:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<table><tr><td>
<pre>
**Hello**,

_world_.
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
.
<table><tr><td>
<pre>
**Hello**,
<p><em>world</em>.
</pre></p>
</td></tr></table>
````````````````````````````````

In this case, the HTML block is terminated by the blank line â€” the `**Hello**`
text remains verbatim â€” and regular parsing resumes, with a paragraph,
emphasised `world` and inline and block HTML following.

All types of [HTML blocks] except type 7 may interrupt
a paragraph.  Blocks of type 7 may not interrupt a paragraph.
(This restriction is intended to prevent unwanted interpretation
of long tags inside a wrapped paragraph as starting HTML blocks.)

Some simple{panels}s follow.  Here are some basic HTML blocks
of type 6:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
           hi
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

okay.
.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
           hi
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>okay.</p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
 <div>
  *hello*
         <foo><a>
.
 <div>
  *hello*
         <foo><a>
````````````````````````````````


A block can also start with a closing tag:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
</div>
*foo*
.
</div>
*foo*
````````````````````````````````


Here we have two HTML blocks with a Markdown paragraph between them:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<DIV CLASS="foo">

*Markdown*

</DIV>
.
<DIV CLASS="foo">
<p><em>Markdown</em></p>
</DIV>
````````````````````````````````


The tag on the first line can be partial, as long
as it is split where there would be whitespace:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div id="foo"
  class="bar">
</div>
.
<div id="foo"
  class="bar">
</div>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div id="foo" class="bar
  baz">
</div>
.
<div id="foo" class="bar
  baz">
</div>
````````````````````````````````


An open tag need not be closed:
````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div>
*foo*

*bar*
.
<div>
*foo*
<p><em>bar</em></p>
````````````````````````````````



A partial tag need not even be completed (garbage
in, garbage out):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div id="foo"
*hi*
.
<div id="foo"
*hi*
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div class
foo
.
<div class
foo
````````````````````````````````


The initial tag doesn't even need to be a valid
tag, as long as it starts like one:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div *???-&&&-<---
*foo*
.
<div *???-&&&-<---
*foo*
````````````````````````````````


In type 6 blocks, the initial tag need not be on a line by
itself:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div><a href="bar">*foo*</a></div>
.
<div><a href="bar">*foo*</a></div>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<table><tr><td>
foo
</td></tr></table>
.
<table><tr><td>
foo
</td></tr></table>
````````````````````````````````


Everything until the next blank line or end of document
gets included in the HTML block.  So, in the following
example, what looks like a Markdown code block
is actually part of the HTML block, which continues until a blank
line or the end of the document is reached:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div></div>
``` c
int x = 33;
```
.
<div></div>
``` c
int x = 33;
```
````````````````````````````````


To start an [HTML block] with a tag that is *not* in the
list of block-level tags in (6), you must put the tag by
itself on the first line (and it must be complete):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<a href="foo">
*bar*
</a>
.
<a href="foo">
*bar*
</a>
````````````````````````````````


In type 7 blocks, the [tag name] can be anything:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<Warning>
*bar*
</Warning>
.
<Warning>
*bar*
</Warning>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<i class="foo">
*bar*
</i>
.
<i class="foo">
*bar*
</i>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
</ins>
*bar*
.
</ins>
*bar*
````````````````````````````````


These rules are designed to allow us to work with tags that
can function as either block-level or inline-level tags.
The `<del>` tag is a nice{panels}.  We can surround content with
`<del>` tags in three different ways.  In this case, we get a raw
HTML block, because the `<del>` tag is on a line by itself:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<del>
*foo*
</del>
.
<del>
*foo*
</del>
````````````````````````````````


In this case, we get a raw HTML block that just includes
the `<del>` tag (because it ends with the following blank
line).  So the contents get interpreted as CommonMark:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<del>

*foo*

</del>
.
<del>
<p><em>foo</em></p>
</del>
````````````````````````````````


Finally, in this case, the `<del>` tags are interpreted
as [raw HTML] *inside* the CommonMark paragraph.  (Because
the tag is not on a line by itself, we get inline HTML
rather than an [HTML block].)

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<del>*foo*</del>
.
<p><del><em>foo</em></del></p>
````````````````````````````````


HTML tags designed to contain literal content
(`pre`, `script`, `style`, `textarea`), comments, processing instructions,
and declarations are treated somewhat differently.
Instead of ending at the first blank line, these blocks
end at the first line containing a corresponding end tag.
As a result, these blocks can contain blank lines:

A pre tag (type 1):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<pre language="haskell"><code>
import Text.HTML.TagSoup

main :: IO ()
main = print $ parseTags tags
</code></pre>
okay
.
<pre language="haskell"><code>
import Text.HTML.TagSoup

main :: IO ()
main = print $ parseTags tags
</code></pre>
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````


A script tag (type 1):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<script type="text/javascript">
// JavaScript{panels}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
okay
.
<script type="text/javascript">
// JavaScript{panels}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````


A textarea tag (type 1):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<textarea>

*foo*

_bar_

</textarea>
.
<textarea>

*foo*

_bar_

</textarea>
````````````````````````````````

A style tag (type 1):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<style
  type="text/css">
h1 {color:red;}

p {color:blue;}
</style>
okay
.
<style
  type="text/css">
h1 {color:red;}

p {color:blue;}
</style>
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````


If there is no matching end tag, the block will end at the
end of the document (or the enclosing [block quote][block quotes]
or [list item][list items]):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<style
  type="text/css">

foo
.
<style
  type="text/css">

foo
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
> <div>
> foo

bar
.
<blockquote>
<div>
foo
</blockquote>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
- <div>
- foo
.
<ul>
<li>
<div>
</li>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


The end tag can occur on the same line as the start tag:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<style>p{color:red;}</style>
*foo*
.
<style>p{color:red;}</style>
<p><em>foo</em></p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<!-- foo -->*bar*
*baz*
.
<!-- foo -->*bar*
<p><em>baz</em></p>
````````````````````````````````


Note that anything on the last line after the
end tag will be included in the [HTML block]:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<script>
foo
</script>1. *bar*
.
<script>
foo
</script>1. *bar*
````````````````````````````````


A comment (type 2):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<!-- Foo

bar
   baz -->
okay
.
<!-- Foo

bar
   baz -->
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````



A processing instruction (type 3):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<?php

  echo '>';

?>
okay
.
<?php

  echo '>';

?>
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````


A declaration (type 4):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<!DOCTYPE html>
.
<!DOCTYPE html>
````````````````````````````````


CDATA (type 5):

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<![CDATA[
function matchwo(a,b)
{
  if (a < b && a < 0) then {
    return 1;

  } else {

    return 0;
  }
}
]]>
okay
.
<![CDATA[
function matchwo(a,b)
{
  if (a < b && a < 0) then {
    return 1;

  } else {

    return 0;
  }
}
]]>
<p>okay</p>
````````````````````````````````


The opening tag can be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation, but not
four:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
  <!-- foo -->

    <!-- foo -->
.
  <!-- foo -->
<pre><code>&lt;!-- foo --&gt;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
  <div>

    <div>
.
  <div>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


An HTML block of types 1--6 can interrupt a paragraph, and need not be
preceded by a blank line.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
<div>
bar
</div>
.
<p>Foo</p>
<div>
bar
</div>
````````````````````````````````


However, a following blank line is needed, except at the end of
a document, and except for blocks of types 1--5, [above][HTML
block]:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div>
bar
</div>
*foo*
.
<div>
bar
</div>
*foo*
````````````````````````````````


HTML blocks of type 7 cannot interrupt a paragraph:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
<a href="bar">
baz
.
<p>Foo
<a href="bar">
baz</p>
````````````````````````````````


This rule differs from John Gruber's original Markdown syntax
specification, which says:

> The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements â€”
> e.g. `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. â€” must be separated from
> surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the
> block should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

In some ways Gruber's rule is more restrictive than the one given
here:

- It requires that an HTML block be preceded by a blank line.
- It does not allow the start tag to be indented.
- It requires a matching end tag, which it also does not allow to
  be indented.

Most Markdown implementations (including some of Gruber's own) do not
respect all of these restrictions.

There is one respect, however, in which Gruber's rule is more liberal
than the one given here, since it allows blank lines to occur inside
an HTML block.  There are two reasons for disallowing them here.
First, it removes the need to parse balanced tags, which is
expensive and can require backtracking from the end of the document
if no matching end tag is found. Second, it provides a very simple
and flexible way of including Markdown content inside HTML tags:
simply separate the Markdown from the HTML using blank lines:

Compare:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div>

*Emphasized* text.

</div>
.
<div>
<p><em>Emphasized</em> text.</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
<div>
*Emphasized* text.
</div>
.
<div>
*Emphasized* text.
</div>
````````````````````````````````


Some Markdown implementations have adopted a convention of
interpreting content inside tags as text if the open tag has
the attribute `markdown=1`.  The rule given above seems a simpler and
more elegant way of achieving the same expressive power, which is also
much simpler to parse.

The main potential drawback is that one can no longer paste HTML
blocks into Markdown documents with 100% reliability.  However,
*in most cases* this will work fine, because the blank lines in
HTML are usually followed by HTML block tags.  For{panels}:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<table>

<tr>

<td>
Hi
</td>

</tr>

</table>
.
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Hi
</td>
</tr>
</table>
````````````````````````````````


There are problems, however, if the inner tags are indented
*and* separated by spaces, as then they will be interpreted as
an indented code block:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
<table>

  <tr>

    <td>
      Hi
    </td>

  </tr>

</table>
.
<table>
  <tr>
<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;
  Hi
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>
  </tr>
</table>
````````````````````````````````


Fortunately, blank lines are usually not necessary and can be
deleted.  The exception is inside `<pre>` tags, but as described
[above][HTML blocks], raw HTML blocks starting with `<pre>`
*can* contain blank lines.

## Link reference definitions

A [link reference definition](#@)
consists of a [link label], optionally preceded by up to three spaces of
indentation, followed
by a colon (`:`), optional spaces or tabs (including up to one
[line ending]), a [link destination],
optional spaces or tabs (including up to one
[line ending]), and an optional [link
title], which if it is present must be separated
from the [link destination] by spaces or tabs.
No further character may occur.

A [link reference definition]
does not correspond to a structural element of a document.  Instead, it
defines a label which can be used in [reference links]
and reference-style [images] elsewhere in the document.  [Link
reference definitions] can come either before or after the links that use
them.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url "title"

[foo]
.
<p><a href="/url" title="title">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
   [foo]: 
      /url  
           'the title'  

[foo]
.
<p><a href="/url" title="the title">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
[Foo*bar\]]:my_(url) 'title (with parens)'

[Foo*bar\]]
.
<p><a href="my_(url)" title="title (with parens)">Foo*bar]</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
[Foo bar]:
<my url>
'title'

[Foo bar]
.
<p><a href="my%20url" title="title">Foo bar</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


The title may extend over multiple lines:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url '
title
line1
line2
'

[foo]
.
<p><a href="/url" title="
title
line1
line2
">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


However, it may not contain a [blank line]:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url 'title

with blank line'

[foo]
.
<p>[foo]: /url 'title</p>
<p>with blank line'</p>
<p>[foo]</p>
````````````````````````````````


The title may be omitted:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]:
/url

[foo]
.
<p><a href="/url">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


The link destination may not be omitted:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]:

[foo]
.
<p>[foo]:</p>
<p>[foo]</p>
````````````````````````````````

 However, an empty link destination may be specified using
 angle brackets:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: <>

[foo]
.
<p><a href="">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

The title must be separated from the link destination by
spaces or tabs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: <bar>(baz)

[foo]
.
<p>[foo]: <bar>(baz)</p>
<p>[foo]</p>
````````````````````````````````


Both title and destination can contain backslash escapes
and literal backslashes:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url\bar\*baz "foo\"bar\baz"

[foo]
.
<p><a href="/url%5Cbar*baz" title="foo&quot;bar\baz">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


A link can come before its corresponding definition:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]

[foo]: url
.
<p><a href="url">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


If there are several matching definitions, the first one takes
precedence:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]

[foo]: first
[foo]: second
.
<p><a href="first">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


As noted in the section on [Links], matching of labels is
case-insensitive (see [matches]).

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[FOO]: /url

[Foo]
.
<p><a href="/url">Foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
[Î‘Î“Î©]: /Ï†Î¿Ï…

[Î±Î³Ï‰]
.
<p><a href="/%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%85">Î±Î³Ï‰</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


Whether something is a [link reference definition] is
independent of whether the link reference it defines is
used in the document.  Thus, for{panels}, the following
document contains just a link reference definition, and
no visible content:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url
.
````````````````````````````````


Here is another one:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[
foo
]: /url
bar
.
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a link reference definition, because there are
characters other than spaces or tabs after the title:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url "title" ok
.
<p>[foo]: /url &quot;title&quot; ok</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is a link reference definition, but it has no title:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url
"title" ok
.
<p>&quot;title&quot; ok</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a link reference definition, because it is indented
four spaces:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
    [foo]: /url "title"

[foo]
.
<pre><code>[foo]: /url &quot;title&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>[foo]</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a link reference definition, because it occurs inside
a code block:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
```
[foo]: /url
```

[foo]
.
<pre><code>[foo]: /url
</code></pre>
<p>[foo]</p>
````````````````````````````````


A [link reference definition] cannot interrupt a paragraph.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
Foo
[bar]: /baz

[bar]
.
<p>Foo
[bar]: /baz</p>
<p>[bar]</p>
````````````````````````````````


However, it can directly follow other block elements, such as headings
and thematic breaks, and it need not be followed by a blank line.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
# [Foo]
[foo]: /url
> bar
.
<h1><a href="/url">Foo</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>bar</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url
bar
===
[foo]
.
<h1>bar</h1>
<p><a href="/url">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /url
===
[foo]
.
<p>===
<a href="/url">foo</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


Several [link reference definitions]
can occur one after another, without intervening blank lines.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]: /foo-url "foo"
[bar]: /bar-url
  "bar"
[baz]: /baz-url

[foo],
[bar],
[baz]
.
<p><a href="/foo-url" title="foo">foo</a>,
<a href="/bar-url" title="bar">bar</a>,
<a href="/baz-url">baz</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


[Link reference definitions] can occur
inside block containers, like lists and block quotations.  They
affect the entire document, not just the container in which they
are defined:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
[foo]

> [foo]: /url
.
<p><a href="/url">foo</a></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


## Paragraphs

A sequence of non-blank lines that cannot be interpreted as other
kinds of blocks forms a [paragraph](#@).
The contents of the paragraph are the result of parsing the
paragraph's raw content as inlines.  The paragraph's raw content
is formed by concatenating the lines and removing initial and final
spaces or tabs.

A simple{panels} with two paragraphs:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
aaa

bbb
.
<p>aaa</p>
<p>bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


Paragraphs can contain multiple lines, but no blank lines:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
aaa
bbb

ccc
ddd
.
<p>aaa
bbb</p>
<p>ccc
ddd</p>
````````````````````````````````


Multiple blank lines between paragraphs have no effect:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
aaa


bbb
.
<p>aaa</p>
<p>bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


Leading spaces or tabs are skipped:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
  aaa
 bbb
.
<p>aaa
bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


Lines after the first may be indented any amount, since indented
code blocks cannot interrupt paragraphs.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
aaa
             bbb
                                       ccc
.
<p>aaa
bbb
ccc</p>
````````````````````````````````


However, the first line may be preceded by up to three spaces of indentation.
Four spaces of indentation is too many:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
   aaa
bbb
.
<p>aaa
bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


````````````````````````````````{panels}
    aaa
bbb
.
<pre><code>aaa
</code></pre>
<p>bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


Final spaces or tabs are stripped before inline parsing, so a paragraph
that ends with two or more spaces will not end with a [hard line
break]:

````````````````````````````````{panels}
aaa     
bbb     
.
<p>aaa<br />
bbb</p>
````````````````````````````````


## Blank lines

[Blank lines] between block-level elements are ignored,
except for the role they play in determining whether a [list]
is [tight] or [loose].

Blank lines at the beginning and end of the document are also ignored.

````````````````````````````````{panels}
  

aaa
  

# aaa

  
.
<p>aaa</p>
<h1>aaa</h1>
````````````````````````````````
